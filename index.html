                    <p>Hello.  I am an indoors guy whose passions are reading and gaming.  I hope to one day contribute to the development of media similar to those which I myself have been moved by.</p>

                    <p>I am not exactly a very interesting person; one of my greatest joys in the week is simply drinking a cup of boba drink.</p>

                        <h3>A Puppeteer's Journey</h3>
                        <p>A young woman finds herself stranded in an unfamiliar city, with no idea who she is and why she is there.  Though she attempts to leave, there is no exit in sight, and no one in the city seems to have any conception of the life outside of it.  She is given shelter by an elderly puppeteer, given the name of "Citrus".  Citrus helps with her work as she works to master the art of puppetry and perhaps find out just who she is.  Follow Citrus's journey in this text-based adventure game with over 20 possible endings.</p>

Until two hundred years ago, when the incarnated spirit Theresa transformed the earth and built a vast school within which her apostles could live, learn, and play.  Today, it is now one of the very few places on Lyfnaheim where those from any sentient race can rub figurative shoulders together as equals.
